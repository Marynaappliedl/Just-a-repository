# Second Project of a personal website

## Description

I created this project to enhance portfolio visibility and improve the user experience for individuals with various needs, including those with disabilities, so this code includes multiple commentaries.

-The primary goal of this project is to create a mock version of my portfolio website and to train working with pseudo classes in CSS
-I learnt how to work with cards more effectively
-An about section leads straight to the section in the body, while other sections lead to specific websites
-Also, I have managed to make images for generic and card content adjustable
-I made header text colours change after click and hover
-I`ve created a colorful hover on the page
## Installation

To access all the files, you can use my repository.

## Usage

The website features a website with portfolio, Github and a couple of current projects
## Credits

I used the following resources to develop this project:
A hover selector to change my header text display when it is clicked on or even hoovered, cards bootstrap code and grid containers sections to size my cards just the way I want them to be on my website
